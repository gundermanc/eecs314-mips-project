Our EECS 314 MIPS Assembly Project:
A suite of Math functions.

Suite					Owner			Progress
Menus					Gundermanc		25%
Temperature Conversions Gundermanc		100%
Length Conversions		Gundermanc		100%
Measures of Center		las203			70%
Linear alg.				pabb			0%

System Requirements:
Running this application requires MARS MIPS simulator. To execute, open the
gundermanc-main.asm file, build, and execute. This is the entry point. From
here, you can navigate the menus using the number keys and [Enter].
